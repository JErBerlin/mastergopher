## 📁 Structure

Each directory represents a module or topic from the course, prepended by a digit made of the course day and the topic number for each day:

21_maps/
22_pointers/
24_functions/
31_interfaces/
32_sync/
33_channels/
...

meaning that maps, pointers and functions are the topics covered the second day of the training.

Each `.go` file is runnable independently using `go run`.
